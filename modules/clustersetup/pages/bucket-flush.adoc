= Flush a Bucket

[abstract]
Full, Cluster, and Bucket Administrators can use the btn:[Flush] button to start bucket flushing and delete every object in a bucket.

Flushing will work only if this option was configured either during the initial xref:bucket-setup.adoc[bucket setup] or after the xref:change-settings-bucket.adoc[bucket settings] have been changed.

WARNING: It is recommended that the flush capability is not used in production systems as it irreversibly deletes every document in the bucket.
Even for use cases where this is the desired behaviour, flushing is not recommended as it is a very disruptive process.
You can control and limit the ability to flush individual buckets by setting the `flushEnabled` parameter on a bucket in the Couchbase Web Console.

. Go to the [.ui]*Data Buckets* tab and click the blue triangle next to the bucket name.
. Click on the btn:[Flush] button.

You can also use the commands the CLI command xref:cli:cbcli/bucket-flush.adoc#cbcli-bucket-flush[bucket-flush] and REST API xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-flush.adoc#rest-bucket-flush[rest-bucket-flush.]
