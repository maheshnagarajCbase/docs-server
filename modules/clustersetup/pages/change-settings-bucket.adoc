The [.ui]*Configure Bucket* dialog offers the same options as the xref:create-bucket.adoc[Create a New Bucket] dialog.

You can change bucket setting also with the CLI command xref:cli:cbcli/bucket-edit.adoc[bucket-edit] or the REST command xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-parameters.adoc[rest-bucket-parameters].
