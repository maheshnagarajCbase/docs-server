= Delete a Bucket

[abstract]
Full Administrators and Cluster Administrators can delete a bucket.

Deleting a bucket and then recreating it is sometimes faster than deleting all objects in an existing bucket.

To delete a bucket using the Couchbase Web Console:

. Go to the [.ui]*Data Buckets* tab and click the blue triangle next to the bucket name.
. Click [.ui]*Delete*.

. The warning message will appear before you remove the bucket.

. Click on [.ui]*Delete* and confirm the deletion.

You can also use the CLI command xref:cli:cbcli/bucket-delete.adoc[bucket-delete] or REST API command xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-delete.adoc#rest-bucket-delete[rest-bucket-delete].
