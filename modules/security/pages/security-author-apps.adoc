= Authorization for Applications
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Authorization for applications in Couchbase defines what applications can perform in the system.

Administrators (Full, Cluster, and Bucket) can set passwords for buckets to grant applications access to these buckets.

Applications use bucket passwords to authenticate to a Couchbase bucket, and then they obtain complete read-write access to it.
