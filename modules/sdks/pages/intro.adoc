Couchbase offers a number of software development kits (SDKs) that enable programmatic access to Couchbase Server.

* xref:2.5@c-sdk::c-intro.adoc[C SDK 2.4/2.5] The Couchbase C SDK provides a fast, callback-based API for interacting with your Couchbase cluster.
* xref:1.0@go-sdk::introduction.adoc[Go SDK 1.0] The Couchbase Go SDK is a native Go library and uses the high-performance gocbcore to handle communicating to the cluster over Couchbase’s binary protocols..
* xref:2.2@java-sdk::java-intro.adoc[Java SDK 2.2] The Couchbase Java SDK provides synchronous and asynchronous (reactive) interfaces that allow your applications to interact efficiently with a Couchbase Server cluster.
* xref:2.2@dotnet-sdk::dotnet-intro.adoc[.NET SDK 2.2] The .NET Couchbase SDK provides a way to store and retrieve your objects to and from a Couchbase cluster.
It can be used via a synchronous or asynchronous interface.
* xref:2.1@nodejs-sdk::introduction.adoc[Node.js SDK 2.0/2.1] This is a native Node.js module and uses Couchbase's high performance C library to handle communicating to the cluster over Couchbase’s binary protocols.
* xref:2.1@php-sdk::php-intro.adoc[PHP SDK 2.0/2.1] The Couchbase PHP SDK is a native PHP extension and uses the Couchbase high-performance C library to handle communicating to the cluster over Couchbase binary protocols.
* xref:2.0@python-sdk::introduction.adoc[Python SDK 2.0] The Couchbase Python SDK is written as a fast C extension with support for a traditional synchronous API, as well as gevent and twisted APIs for high performance asynchronous programming.
