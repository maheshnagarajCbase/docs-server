= Using Hostnames

[abstract]
Each Couchbase Server's instance can have its hostname.

When you first install Couchbase Server, you can access it using a default IP address.
However, in some cases you might want to provide a hostname for each instance of a server.
Each hostname you provide must be a valid one and will ultimately resolve to a valid IP Address.
If you restart a node, it will use the hostname once again.
If you failover or remove a node from a cluster, the node needs to be configured with the hostname once again.

There are several ways you can provide hostnames:

* When installing a Couchbase Server on a machine.
* When adding a node to an existing cluster for an online upgrade.
* Using a REST API call.

Couchbase Server stores the hostnames in a configuration file on the disk.

== Provide Hostname on Initial Setup

In the first screen, provide either a hostname or IP address under [.ui]*Configure Server Hostname*.

The provided hostname survives node restart.

== Provide Hostname while Adding a Node

If a new node is being added to an existing 2.0.1 or earlier Couchbase Server cluster, first set up the hostname for the new node in the setup wizard.

Add a new node to a cluster by providing either a hostname or IP address under menu:Add Server[Server IP Address].

== Provide Hostname via REST API

Provide a hostname for a node a hostname with the REST request at the [.path]_/node/controller/rename endpoint_.

Provide the hostname before adding a node to a cluster.
If the node is already part of a cluster, Couchbase Server rejects the request and returns an error:

----
error 400 reason: unknown ["Renaming is disallowed for nodes that are already part of a cluster"]
----

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd \
http://127.0.0.1:8091/node/controller/rename -d hostname=shz.localdomain
----

== Hostname Errors

Provide the hostname and port for the node and administrative credentials for the cluster.
The value you provide for `hostname` must be a valid hostname for the node.
Possible errors that can occur:

* [.out]`Could not resolve the host name.
The host name you provide as a parameter does not resolve to a IP address.`
* [.out]`Could not listen.
The host name resolves to an IP address, but no network connection exists for the address.`
* [.out]`Could not rename the node because name was fixed at server start-up.`
* [.out]`Could not save address after rename.`
* [.out]`Requested name host name is not allowed.
Invalid host name provided.`
* [.out]`Renaming is disallowed for nodes that are already part of a cluster.`
