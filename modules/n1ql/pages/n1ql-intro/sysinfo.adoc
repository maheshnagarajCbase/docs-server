= Getting system information
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
N1QL has a system catalog that stores metadata about a database.
The system catalog is a namespace called _system_.

There is a keyspace for each type of artifact.
The keyspace names are plural in order to avoid conflicting with N1QL keywords.

== Logical hierarchy

N1QL has the following artifacts:

* *Datastores*
+
Datastores are similar to sites.
A datastore is a database deployment, for example, a server cluster, cloud service, or mobile installation.
It is analogous to a relation database instance.

* *Namespaces*
+
Namespaces are similar to pools.
A namespace is a unit of authorization, resource allocation, and tenancy.
It is analogous to a relational database or schema.

* *Keyspaces*
+
Keyspaces are similar to buckets.
A keyspace is a set of documents that may vary in structure.
It is a unit of authorization and resource allocation.
It is analogous to a relational database table.

* *Indexes*
+
An index on a keyspace.
It is analogous to a relational database index.
Types of indexes include tree, view, full-text, hash, and other indexes.

* *Dual*
+
The dual keyspace has been added for evaluating constant expressions.
It contains a single entry with no attributes.

== Querying datastores

You can query datastores using the `SELECT` statement as follows:

----
SELECT * FROM system:datastores
----

The query returns the following attributes:

* [.out]`id`: string (id for the datastore)
* [.out]`url`: string (URL for the datastore instance)

== Querying namespaces

You can query namespaces using the `SELECT` statement as follows:

----
SELECT * FROM system:namespaces
----

The query returns the following attributes:

* [.out]`id`: string (id for the namespace)
* [.out]`name`: string (name for the namespace)
* [.out]`store_id`: string (id for the datastore to which the namespace belongs)

== Querying keyspaces

You can query keyspaces using the `SELECT` statement as follows:

----
SELECT * FROM system:keyspaces
----

The query returns the following attributes:

* [.out]`id`: string (id for the keyspace)
* [.out]`name`: string (name for the keyspace)
* [.out]`namespace_id`: string (id for the namespace to which the keyspace belongs)
* [.out]`store_id`: string (id for the datastore to which the keyspace belongs)

== Querying indexes

You can query indexes using the `SELECT` statement as follows:

----
SELECT * FROM system:indexes
----

The query returns the following attributes:

* [.out]`id`: string (id for the index)
* [.out]`name`: string (name for the index)
* [.out]`index_key`: array of strings (list of index keys)
* [.out]`index_type`: string (type of index, for example, view index)
* [.out]`keyspace_id`: string (id for the keyspace to which the index belongs)
* [.out]`namespace_id`: string (id for the namespace to which the index belongs)
* [.out]`store_id`: string (id for the datastore to which the index belongs)

== Querying dual

You can use dual to evaluate constant expressions.

----
SELECT 2+5 FROM system:dual
----

The query returns the result of the  expression, 7 in this case.
