= Pause/Resume Replication

[abstract]
XDCR replication can be paused and resumed using the Couchbase Web Console.

XDCR streams between the source and destination cluster can be paused and later resumed.

After XDCR is resumed, data continues to replicate between the source and destination clusters starting from where it previously left off.

To pause and resume replication, click the replicating and paused icons under the ongoing replication status.

. Using the Couchbase Web Console, navigate to XDCR.
. To pause, under menu:Ongoing Replication[Status], click on the [.ui]*Replicating* icon to pause replication.
