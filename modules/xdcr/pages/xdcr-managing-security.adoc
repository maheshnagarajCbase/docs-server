= XDCR data security

[abstract]
The data replicated between clusters can be encrypted in both uni-directional and bi-directional replications.

When you use Secure Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR), all traffic from the source and destination data centers will be encrypted.
Encryption causes a slight increase in the CPU load since it requires additional CPU cycles.

== Enable XDCR data security

To enable XDCR data security using SSL and create replication:

. On the destination cluster, navigate to menu:Settings[Cluster] and copy the certificate.
+
(Optional) To regenerate the existing destination certificate, click Regenerate before copying.

. In the source cluster, select the [.ui]*XDCR* tab.
. In the [.ui]*Remote Clusters* panel, click Create Cluster Reference to verify or create the cluster reference.
. Select the [.ui]*Enable Encryption* box and paste the certificate in the provided area and click [.ui]*Save*.

. In the [.ui]*Ongoing Replications* panel, click [.ui]*Create Replication*, provide the cluster and bucket information, and click [.ui]*Replicate*.
